For Windows 10 users:

First, you need to sign up an Amazon EC2 instance and save the pem file on your local machine. 
Then make sure that you have SSH server and SSH client option enabled under the Apps & Feature tab on Windows 10.

Open the Windows power shell and navigate to the directory where you kept your pem file. Execute the below command one by one

$path = ".\aws_key_pair_pem_filename.pem"


Reset to remove explicit permissions
icacls.exe $path /reset


Give current user explicit read-permission
icacls.exe $path /GRANT:R "$($env:USERNAME):(R)"


Disable inheritance and remove inherited permissions
icacls.exe $path /inheritance:r

Later connect to the instance by running the command ssh -i "aws_key_pair_pem_filename.pem" ubuntu@ec2-xx-xxx-xxx-x.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com from SSH Client.
